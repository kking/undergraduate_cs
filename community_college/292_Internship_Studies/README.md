# CS292

Fall 2018 coursework for Computer Science Internship Studies at MiraCosta College.

Worked with computer science faculty to incorporate continuous integration tools and unit testing into classroom assignments to demonstrate test-driven development (CS113 - Data Structures and Algorithms). In addition, two culturally-sustaining lesson plans were produced with lectures, labs, and rubrics to measure a course's student learning outcomes (CS111 - Introduction to Computer Science I: Java).
